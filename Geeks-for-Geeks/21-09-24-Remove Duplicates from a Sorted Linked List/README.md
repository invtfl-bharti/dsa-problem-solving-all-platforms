Given a singly linked list. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if it exists).
Note: Try not to use extra space. The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.

Examples:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->2->4->5
Output: 2 -> 4 -> 5

Explanation: In the given linked list 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, only 2 occurs more than 1 time. So we need to remove it once.
Input:
LinkedList: 2->2->2->2->2
Output: 2

Explanation: In the given linked list  2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2, 2 is the only element and is repeated 5 times. So we need to remove any four 2.
Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes, data of nodes <= 105
